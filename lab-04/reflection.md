1.  Given the discussion of the user experience and usability in the lesson, think of a design that you've encountered (either a material object     in the world or a digital interface) that you found frustrating or confusing. Discuss your experience using it in terms of Figure 03. User       motivation vs Interface Complexity from the lesson.
    
    <ul>Several designs that I have encountered initially create a confusing user experience. One, is how to operate the windshield wipers in cars. There seems to be no standard way to turn on and control the intermittency of the wipers; some stalks need to be pushed up, some down. Plus, given the position of the wiper stalk, there is no clear indication of which to use; one could be the directional and another for wipers, or sometimes both are incorporated into one stalk. Web-based maps that are a component of a web page are also misleading. It seems that in this  age, "slippy" maps are commonn, however I have encounter an increasing number that do not allow the panning feature which is odd. Finally, any number of various electronic gadgets (bluetooth scale, fitness tracker, bike computer) are not intuitive at all and takes a good amount of time with user manuals to understand how to program and set settings.</ul>

2.  Garrett begins his process of working through the "elements of the user experience" by asking the "why should we make this product?",       before moving on to build it. Consider a map you'd like to hypothetically create (just imagine that you can get the data you need           for it) and answer these two questions: 
    <ul>Maps that I would like to attempt to create:
    •	The spatial distribution of existing urban farms and potential areas for locating urban farm plots.
    •	Locations of food deserts and swamps to help direct the placement of farmers markets.
    •	Socio-economic characteristics of the greater Chicagoland area (City of Chicago and outlying suburbs)</ul>

    What do we want to get out of this product?
    <ul>Visualize on a map the spatial distribution of "things" and how these "things" (e.g. spatial phenomena) are similiar or dissimilar to nearby things. Also show how the mapped data relates to the nearby or it's general setting. Additionally, my goal with this project is incorporate many map techniques and elements (including user interaction) into the map in the form of slider bar, toggle buttons/dropdown menu, pop-up boxes, and perhaps a line graph that may show change over a time period. Ideally, this map would be a capstone type of web map that may have some connection to a local, future employer in the city that I am relocating to in the hope of securing a job. </ul>
    
    What do our users want to get out of it?
    <ul>Be able to understand and process multiple data sources that are either visualized on a map as point locations, gradient circles, or a choropleth map. Additionally, I would like to incorporate text and possible photos in a side-panel.The map ought to provide the user with a tool or resource that provides insight in some way in the context of an interactive map. The balance is to provide adequate and necessary information and detail without being overly confusing or burdensome to navigate.</ul>
    
3.  Create a low-fidelity wireframe or mockup of the map you're imagining in question 02. 
    <ul>I have taken screen captures of three other students maps that are featured on the NMP map gallery. These three maps represent my goal of producing a fairly sophisticated and functional map.</ul>
